The Lonely Gallery can be extended with designs.

Place the design file (named SomethingDesign.php) in the config
directory of your gallery. It is then automatically loaded by the
gallery. You can use only one design at a time.

The default dark design is used if you don't have any other design
in your config directory.

Those are the official designes:

 * Bright
 This design builds up on the default dark design and changes it to
 brighter colours without changing the shape.
