The Lonely Gallery can be extended with modules.

Place the module file (named SomethingModule.php) in the config
directory of your gallery. It is then automatically loaded by the
gallery.

Those are the official modules:

 * AlbumNames
 Lets you choose names for your albums that aren't the folder names.

 * Audio
 Includes MP3/OGG/WAV audio files into the gallery. New browsers
 should be able to play them directly.

 * ImageInfo
 Reads and displays EXIF and IPTC meta data from images.

 * LargeAlbumView
 Lets you display all images of an album on one page in large. Great
 for panoramas combined with the 'useOriginals' setting.

 * Link
 Lets you add web links with a cover image.

 * ManyFiles
 Adds support for many different file types like documents, audio,
 video, archives, ... . It displays icons for different groups of
 file types.

 * Text
 With this module you can add text to your gallery that is displayed
 between the images of an album. You can use this module to guide
 visitors through your holiday photos.

 * Video
 Includes MP4/OGV/WEBM video files into the gallery. New browsers
 should be able to play them directly.

 * Vimeo
 Allows you to embedd Vimeo videos directly into the gallery.

 * YouTube
 Allows you to embedd YouTube videos directly into the gallery.

 * Zoom
 With this module if an image would not fit the screen it can be
 enlarged and viewed by moving the mouse. Works great with the
 'useOriginals' setting and panoramas.
