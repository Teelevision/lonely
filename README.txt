Lonely PHP Gallery is a image gallery that aims to be simple in many 
ways: Its functionality is limited to the basics you need to properly 
display and navigate through your images and can be extended by modules 
if needed. Its design is plain - the focus should lie on your images. 
Its implementation uses widely supported and up to date standards like 
HTML5 and CSS3. Its configuration is based on text files and does not 
require any PHP knowledge.

Installation

Simply put the index.php on your webspace and call it. You will find 
optional modules and designs in the config directory. For further 
configuration see the documentation in the index.php file.
