Test: PHP's memory limit and image sizes
Date: around july 2013

I placed images of different sizes and contents in my gallery and 
started with a memory limit of 1M and doubled it in each pass until 
1024M. In each pass I called the gallery script to see which images were 
created and which weren't probably because of insufficent memory. This 
was only a small test. 

mem   | number of pixels of images that worked first
limit | in the pass (rounded)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1M | 11k
   2M | 45k
   4M | 63k, 266k, 288k, 327k, 360k, 430k
   8M | 423k, 583k, 593k, 1.2M
  16M | 1M, 1.4M, 1.8M, 1.9M, 2.8M
  32M | 1.9M, 1.9M, 2M, 2.8M, 5.8M, 6.1M
  64M | 4M, 5.6M, 5.8M, 8M, 8M, 8M, 8M, 8M, 9.2M, 10M, 10M
 128M | (no new)
 256M | (no new)
 512M | 47M
1024M | 112M

From this table I created this recommendation:
megapixels => memory_limit
2 => 16M
5 => 32M
10 => 64M
50 => 512M
100 => 1024M
Or even simpler: double the megapixels double the memory.
